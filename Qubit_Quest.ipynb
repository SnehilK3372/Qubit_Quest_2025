It provides the tools needed to design quantum circuits, run them on simulators, and even execute them on real quantum hardware made available through the IBM Quantum Experience. Just like Python libraries such as NumPy or TensorFlow make it easier to do mathematics or machine learning, Qiskit makes it easier to explore and experiment with quantum computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "At its core, Qiskit allows you to **construct quantum circuits**: diagrams that describe the sequence of operations (quantum gates) applied to qubits. You can think of a quantum circuit as the \"program\" for a quantum computer. Qiskit then takes care of translating this abstract program into instructions that can be executed on different backends, whether they are high-performance simulators or actual quantum chips.\n",
    "\n",
    "A powerful feature of Qiskit is that it seamlessly bridges the gap between **theory and practice**. For example, you can start by simulating small circuits on your laptop to verify theoretical ideas like superposition and entanglement. Then, with only minor changes to your code, you can submit the exact same circuits to run on a real IBM quantum processor over the cloud. This allows learners and researchers to experiment with genuine quantum hardware early on, making Qiskit not just a simulator, but a gateway to hands-on quantum computing.\n",
